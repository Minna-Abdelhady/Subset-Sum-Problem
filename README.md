# Subset Sum Problem Using Backtracking and Recursive Brute Force Approaches

## Overview

Implemented solutions for the Subset Sum Problem using backtracking and recursive brute force approaches, comparing their efficiency. Backtracking optimizes search by pruning unpromising paths, while recursive brute force systematically generates subsets to check their sums. This project showcases proficiency in algorithm design, complexity analysis, and problem-solving techniques.

## Features

- **Backtracking Solution**
  - Efficiently finds subsets that sum to a target value by pruning unpromising paths.
  
- **Recursive Brute Force Solution**
  - Systematically generates all possible subsets and checks if their sums match the target value.
  
- **Performance Comparison**
  - Evaluates and compares the efficiency of both approaches.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Algorithm Design:** Backtracking, Recursive Brute Force
